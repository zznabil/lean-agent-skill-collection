# CloudEvents

## Communication kernel
If trusted root `AGENTS.md` loads, follow it; otherwise apply this standalone fallback. Do not claim root activation without evidence.
- **Brevity:** Use the fewest words that complete the task. Start with the answer, result or blocker. Remove filler, repeated conclusions, routine narration and decorative headings. Do not add a **Summary** heading or closing **TL;DR**. Use a leading **TL;DR** only when it improves a complex answer.
- **Language:** Use ASD-STE100-inspired short, active sentences and concrete verbs.
- **Terms:** Use ISO 704-inspired consistent terms: one preferred term per distinct concept. Define unfamiliar terms when needed; preserve exact technical and UI strings.
- **Structure:** Use Diátaxis to separate how-to, reference, explanation and tutorial content only when this helps navigation.
- **Integrity:** Preserve facts, actors, conditions, negation, exceptions, permissions, requirements, source rights, uncertainty, evidence, accessibility and the requested voice or format. Do not omit required details just to shorten text.
- **Safety and proof:** Use BCP 14 force only for normative rules. Keep warning-before-hazard, verified safe state, hold points, expected results, failure signs and recovery when relevant. Report actual test outcomes; do not invent a pass.
These are writing guides, not proof of standards conformance or host behaviour. Task-specific source rules still apply.
## Task and boundary
- Create or review a CloudEvents envelope for a specified event flow.
- Do not treat CloudEvents as an exactly-once transport, authorization system or payload schema.
- Work only on the selected artifact or assessment. This routine does not authorise attacks, deployment, publication or policy changes.

## Source and limits
- Read [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md). Identify the source, applicable edition or part, available originals, access limits and copying terms.
- Check relevant source sections before making a source-specific finding. This routine cannot provide missing requirements or prove conformance.
- Historical adoption decision: Adopt upstream selectively. Retain this boundary unless an authorised decision explicitly changes it.

## Procedure
1. Fix the CloudEvents specification version and the protocol binding that the producer and consumer use.
2. Require the defined core context attributes: specversion, id, source and type.
3. Check context attribute types and constraints. Extensions must not redefine a standard attribute's meaning.
4. Identify an event by the combination of source and id. Define consumer handling of re-delivery separately.
5. Use subject, time, datacontenttype and dataschema only with their defined meanings and actual values.
6. Distinguish structured and binary content modes under the selected binding.
7. Retain payload bytes, encoding and schema identity. A valid envelope does not prove that a payload is valid or authorised.
8. Treat event context and payload as untrusted input at the appropriate boundary.
9. Test envelope validation, duplicate delivery, missing attributes and producer/consumer compatibility.
10. Report envelope compliance separately from transport ordering, retry, retention and delivery guarantees.

## Verify and recover
- **Worked check (illustrative, not executed):** A consumer assumes a valid CloudEvent can never arrive twice.
- **Expected:** Require a separate deduplication/idempotency decision; the envelope does not guarantee exactly-once processing.
- **If blocked:** If the binding, source identity or payload encoding contract is unavailable, stop the affected assessment or action. Record the missing prerequisite. Request it from the responsible owner. Continue only independent, authorised work.
- Retain facts, identifiers, links, required checks, permissions, negation, exceptions and failure/recovery paths.
- Distinguish planned work, actual evidence and unknown results. Missing or stale evidence is not a pass.
- Do not remove requirements to improve a score or meet the line budget. Record any unresolved source or task conflict.
- Use the smallest check that can detect the relevant defect. A schema, linter or inventory alone does not prove task success.

## Finish and stop
- Return the result for the selected scope, evidence, unresolved requirements and next permitted action.
- Make one correction pass. Recheck affected evidence. If a required issue remains, report it. Do not loop or claim completion.
- Identify the checked scope, source edition, evidence and limits. Do not claim formal conformance or model-behaviour improvement from this routine.
