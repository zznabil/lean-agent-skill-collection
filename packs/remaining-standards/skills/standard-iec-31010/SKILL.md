# IEC 31010 risk assessment techniques

## Lean communication kernel fallback (standalone)
- If trusted root `AGENTS.md` is loaded, its policy governs this skill. Otherwise MUST apply this lean communication kernel fallback; skill-specific rules refine it.
- Lead with the main point and familiar words (CDC Clear Communication Index). Use short, active, direct technical sentences (ASD-STE100).
- Separate how-to, reference and explanation when useful (Diátaxis). Keep simple replies short.
- For normative requirements, use BCP 14 (RFC 2119/8174) uppercase MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY without changing force. Use NASA-style one actor, action and observable verification target.
- For critical or risky work only, put ANSI-style warnings before hazards and WHO-style hold points before critical or irreversible steps.
- Before destructive or hazardous work, verify actual state (OSHA-style). When failure is plausible, state expected result, failure sign and recovery (FDA human-factors style).
- Explain difficult mechanisms from simple foundations (Feynman). Contrast noncompliant and compliant code or configuration when useful (SEI CERT).
- For critical procedures, use Summary, Prerequisites, WARNING, Steps, PAUSE/VERIFY, Expected Result and Recovery where useful; add contrast or TL;DR only when helpful.
- Preserve actors, facts, negation, conditions, exceptions, permissions, safety, source scope and evidence limits. Report observed results; missing or stale evidence is not success.
- These are communication/control patterns, not transferred ANSI, WHO, OSHA, FDA or NASA legal or organisational authority. Use other domain standards only when the task requires them.
- For measurable multi-step agent work, use a truthful named 20-cell ASCII progress format when applicable.

## Task and boundary
- Select and apply a risk-assessment technique for a concrete decision.
- Do not require every technique, a full FMEA or a numeric model for a simple low-risk decision.
- Work only on the selected artifact or assessment. This routine does not grant permission to run attacks, deploy, publish or change
  policy.

## Source and limits
- Read [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) for source identity, applicable edition or part, available originals, access limits and copying terms.
- Check relevant source sections before a source-specific finding. This routine cannot supply missing requirements or prove conformance.
- Historical adoption decision: Project-local reference. Keep this boundary unless an authorised decision explicitly changes it.
- Full licensed text was not obtained. This is a Lean application routine grounded in public scope and existing Lean guidance, not a
  clause transcript.
- Obtain the authorised full text before a clause-level assessment. Do not invent definitions, thresholds or conformity results.

## Procedure
1. Define the risk question, decision stakes, lifecycle stage and available time and expertise.
2. Identify the evidence available, its quality, and important uncertainties.
3. Use the authoritative technique guidance to select methods suited to those conditions.
4. Explain what the chosen technique can establish and what it cannot.
5. Specify the inputs, assumptions, participants and outputs before applying the technique.
6. Keep observed data separate from expert estimates and scenario assumptions.
7. Test whether the method overlooks interactions, common causes or dependency effects material to the decision.
8. Check sensitivity where results depend strongly on uncertain inputs.
9. Present the decision-relevant result, limitations and residual uncertainty to the authorised owner.
10. Use the licensed IEC 31010 edition for the method's actual instructions; do not reconstruct unavailable technique tables from
    memory.

## Verify and recover
- **Worked check (illustrative, not executed):** A project lacks failure-rate data but asks for an exact probability estimate.
- **Expected:** Use an appropriate qualitative or scenario approach and expose uncertainty rather than fabricate a quantitative
  model.
- **If blocked:** The technique requires expertise or data that the task does not have. Stop the affected assessment or action. Record the missing prerequisite, request it from the responsible owner and continue only independent, authorised work.
- Preserve facts, identifiers, links, required checks, permissions, negation, exceptions and failure/recovery paths.
- Separate planned work, actual evidence and unknown results. Missing or stale evidence is not a pass.
- Do not delete requirements to improve a score or satisfy the line budget; record an unresolved source or task conflict.
- Use the smallest check that can detect the relevant defect. A schema, linter or inventory alone does not prove task success.

## Finish and stop
- Return the scoped result, evidence, unresolved requirements and next permitted action.
- Make one correction pass and recheck affected evidence. If a required issue remains, report it rather than looping or claiming
  completion.
- Identify the checked scope, source edition, evidence and limits. Do not claim formal conformance or model-behaviour improvement
  from this routine.
