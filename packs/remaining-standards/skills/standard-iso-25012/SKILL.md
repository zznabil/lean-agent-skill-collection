# ISO/IEC 25012 data quality model

## Communication kernel
If trusted root `AGENTS.md` loads, follow it; otherwise apply this standalone fallback. Do not claim root activation without evidence.
- **Brevity:** Use the fewest words that complete the task. Start with the answer, result or blocker. Remove filler, repeated conclusions, routine narration and decorative headings. Do not add a **Summary** heading or closing **TL;DR**. Use a leading **TL;DR** only when it improves a complex answer.
- **Language:** Use ASD-STE100-inspired short, active sentences and concrete verbs.
- **Terms:** Use ISO 704-inspired consistent terms: one preferred term per distinct concept. Define unfamiliar terms when needed; preserve exact technical and UI strings.
- **Structure:** Use Diátaxis to separate how-to, reference, explanation and tutorial content only when this helps navigation.
- **Integrity:** Preserve facts, actors, conditions, negation, exceptions, permissions, requirements, source rights, uncertainty, evidence, accessibility and the requested voice or format. Do not omit required details just to shorten text.
- **Safety and proof:** Use BCP 14 force only for normative rules. Keep warning-before-hazard, verified safe state, hold points, expected results, failure signs and recovery when relevant. Report actual test outcomes; do not invent a pass.
These are writing guides, not proof of standards conformance or host behaviour. Task-specific source rules still apply.
## Conditional execution rules
- For normative requirements, use BCP 14 (RFC 2119/8174) uppercase MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY. Preserve their force. State one actor, action and observable verification target.
- For critical or risky work only, place warnings before hazards and hold points before critical or irreversible steps. Before destructive or hazardous work, verify the actual state.
- When failure is plausible, state the expected result, failure sign and recovery action.
- Explain difficult mechanisms from simple foundations. Contrast noncompliant and compliant code or configuration when useful.
- For critical procedures, keep prerequisites, warnings, verified holds, actions, expected results and recovery; add headings only when useful.
- Give progress only when requested or useful. Keep progress distinct from the verdict.

## Task and boundary
- Create a data-quality profile for a named dataset and use context.
- Do not treat a complete row count as evidence that data is accurate, suitable or accessible.
- Limit work to the selected artifact or assessment. This routine does not permit attacks, deployment, publication or policy changes.

## Source and limits
- Read [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md). Identify the source, applicable edition or part, available originals, access limits and copying terms.
- Check relevant source sections before making a source-specific finding. This routine cannot provide missing requirements or prove conformance.
- Historical adoption decision: Absorb. Retain this boundary unless an authorised decision explicitly changes it.
- The full licensed text was not obtained. This Lean application routine uses public scope and existing Lean guidance. It is not a clause transcript.
- Obtain the authorised full text before a clause-level assessment. Do not invent definitions, thresholds or conformity results.

## Procedure
1. Identify the dataset version, consumers, tasks and operational constraints.
2. Select task-relevant characteristics from the selected data-quality model.
3. Separate inherent data properties from properties that depend on the supporting system.
4. Define each selected characteristic's quality question and acceptance evidence.
5. Check accuracy against an appropriate reference. Consistency between duplicated values is not enough.
6. Assess completeness against required entities and attributes. Do not use an arbitrary percentage alone.
7. Evaluate consistency, credibility, currency and other applicable characteristics separately. Do not treat them as substitutes.
8. Record known defects, provenance and sampling limits. Record the data or system owner responsible for correction.
9. Verify corrections. Check whether changes to data or use conditions invalidate earlier conclusions.
10. Use the full licensed model for complete coverage or conformance. This routine is a use-specific Lean application.

## Verify and recover
- **Worked check (illustrative, not executed):** Every field is populated, but values come from an outdated source.
- **Expected:** Distinguish completeness from currency and accuracy. Populated data is not automatically suitable.
- **If blocked:** If a reference source or intended-use criterion for the claimed quality is absent, stop the affected assessment or action. Record the missing prerequisite and request it from the responsible owner. Continue only independent, authorised work.
- Retain facts, identifiers, links, required checks, permissions, negation, exceptions and failure/recovery paths.
- Distinguish planned work, actual evidence and unknown results. Missing or stale evidence is not a pass.
- Do not remove requirements to improve a score or meet the line budget. Record any unresolved source or task conflict.
- Use the smallest check that can detect the relevant defect. A schema, linter or inventory alone does not prove task success.

## Finish and stop
- Return the scoped result, supporting evidence, unresolved requirements and next permitted action.
- Make one correction pass. Recheck the affected evidence. If a required issue remains, report it. Do not loop or claim completion.
- Identify the checked scope, source edition, evidence and limits. Do not claim formal conformance or model-behaviour improvement from this routine.
