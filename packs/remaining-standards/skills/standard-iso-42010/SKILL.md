# ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 architecture descriptions

## Lean communication kernel fallback (standalone)
- If trusted root `AGENTS.md` is loaded, its policy governs this skill. Otherwise MUST apply this lean communication kernel fallback; skill-specific rules refine it.
- Lead with the main point and familiar words (CDC Clear Communication Index). Use short, active, direct technical sentences (ASD-STE100).
- Separate how-to, reference and explanation when useful (Diátaxis). Keep simple replies short.
- For normative requirements, use BCP 14 (RFC 2119/8174) uppercase MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY without changing force. Use NASA-style one actor, action and observable verification target.
- For critical or risky work only, put ANSI-style warnings before hazards and WHO-style hold points before critical or irreversible steps.
- Before destructive or hazardous work, verify actual state (OSHA-style). When failure is plausible, state expected result, failure sign and recovery (FDA human-factors style).
- Explain difficult mechanisms from simple foundations (Feynman). Contrast noncompliant and compliant code or configuration when useful (SEI CERT).
- For critical procedures, use Summary, Prerequisites, WARNING, Steps, PAUSE/VERIFY, Expected Result and Recovery where useful; add contrast or TL;DR only when helpful.
- Preserve actors, facts, negation, conditions, exceptions, permissions, safety, source scope and evidence limits. Report observed results; missing or stale evidence is not success.
- These are communication/control patterns, not transferred ANSI, WHO, OSHA, FDA or NASA legal or organisational authority. Use other domain standards only when the task requires them.
- For measurable multi-step agent work, use a truthful named 20-cell ASCII progress format when applicable.

## Task and boundary
- Create or review an architecture description for a specified entity of interest.
- Do not replace the architecture with a diagram collection or mandate a modelling notation.
- Work only on the selected artifact or assessment. This routine does not grant permission to run attacks, deploy, publish or change
  policy.

## Source and limits
- Read [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) for source identity, applicable edition or part, available originals, access limits and copying terms.
- Check relevant source sections before a source-specific finding. This routine cannot supply missing requirements or prove conformance.
- Historical adoption decision: Absorb. Keep this boundary unless an authorised decision explicitly changes it.
- Full licensed text was not obtained. This is a Lean application routine grounded in public scope and existing Lean guidance, not a
  clause transcript.
- Obtain the authorised full text before a clause-level assessment. Do not invent definitions, thresholds or conformity results.

## Procedure
1. Name the entity of interest, its environment, stakeholders and architecturally significant concerns.
2. Select viewpoints that define how the relevant concerns will be addressed.
3. Distinguish a viewpoint's conventions from a view of the actual system made using those conventions.
4. Choose models and representations that answer stakeholder questions, using existing project methods where suitable.
5. Record decisions and rationale for important structural choices and rejected alternatives.
6. Identify relationships and consistency rules between views; expose contradictions rather than smoothing them away.
7. Connect architecture descriptions to requirements, interfaces, deployment constraints and evidence.
8. Make missing information, assumptions and unknown states explicit.
9. Review with the relevant stakeholders and update the description when the architecture changes.
10. Use the licensed 42010 edition for required content and conformance; this procedure is not a clause inventory.

## Verify and recover
- **Worked check (illustrative, not executed):** Two diagrams assign the same state to different owning services.
- **Expected:** Record and resolve the ownership inconsistency; do not call the architecture consistent because both diagrams
  render.
- **If blocked:** The stakeholders, system boundary or authoritative ownership decision is unknown. Stop the affected assessment or action. Record the missing prerequisite, request it from the responsible owner and continue only independent, authorised work.
- Preserve facts, identifiers, links, required checks, permissions, negation, exceptions and failure/recovery paths.
- Separate planned work, actual evidence and unknown results. Missing or stale evidence is not a pass.
- Do not delete requirements to improve a score or satisfy the line budget; record an unresolved source or task conflict.
- Use the smallest check that can detect the relevant defect. A schema, linter or inventory alone does not prove task success.

## Finish and stop
- Return the scoped result, evidence, unresolved requirements and next permitted action.
- Make one correction pass and recheck affected evidence. If a required issue remains, report it rather than looping or claiming
  completion.
- Identify the checked scope, source edition, evidence and limits. Do not claim formal conformance or model-behaviour improvement
  from this routine.
